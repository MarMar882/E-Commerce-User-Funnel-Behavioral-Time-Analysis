This document summarizes the main behavioral findings from user interaction data of an online multi-category store, based on over 1 million sampled events.

## 1. Funnel Performance

**User Journey Stages:**
- View → Cart → Purchase

**Session Breakdown:**
- Only View: ~96%
- View + Cart (No Purchase): ~3.5%
- View + Cart + Purchase: ~2%
- Direct Purchase (No Cart): small %

**Key Insight:**
> The majority of sessions stop at the product view stage.  
> However, when users add to cart, the chance of purchase significantly increases (~55% conversion from cart to purchase).  
> Focus should be on improving the transition from View → Cart.

## 2. Time to Cart vs Time to Purchase

**Distributions:**
- Most cart actions happen within **2–5 minutes** of the first product view.
- Purchases tend to happen **later**, with a wider spread up to **1+ hours**.

**Key Insight:**
> Adding to cart is typically an impulsive action.  
> Purchasing, however, takes more consideration and often occurs after a time delay.

## 3. Drop-Off Behavior

**Drop-off Rates:**
- From View to Cart: ~96% drop-off
- From Cart to Purchase: ~45% drop-off

**Key Insight:**
> The largest behavioral leak in the funnel is between View and Cart.  
> Improvements in product detail pages, CTAs, urgency triggers (timers, stock counters), and in-page incentives may help.

## 4. Behavioral Recommendations

- **Optimize View Stage:** Focus on converting more views to cart. Test stronger product visuals, better descriptions, and in-page nudges.
- **Reduce Cart Abandonment:** Use personalized follow-ups (emails, push), simplified checkout UX.
- **Encourage Quick Purchase:** Since many purchases occur quickly, time-limited deals or "buy now" options can increase urgency.

## 5. Next Steps

- Segment analysis by category or device
- Look at multi-session behavior (not just within one session)
- Analyze time between Cart and Purchase for better abandonment recovery strategy
